# lolprotect
some basic encryption/serialization thing

## aren't there better ways of doing this?
yes \
\
but hear me out \
so one day i wanted to bring files from my home computer over to the school computers
since i like using my own tools for programming, but for some reason they don't let
students plug in usbs even though they could just download files off the internet \
\
so i learned rust \
and then i made this. \
to spite them.

## what was the point in learning rust though?
idk for fun lol :crab: :crab: :rocket: :rocket:

## how does it work?
xor encryption for life \
but honestly i should've used des instead that would've been way more secure and saved a
whole lot more time (i like suffering apparently) \
also saves output into a bunch of different files so i can actually upload them to github
since i can't download them off my own site (stupid firewall blocking us from visiting
non educational websites...)
